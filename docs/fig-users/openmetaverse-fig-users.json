Should we consider that? educators, gamers\r\nHow to define a user: producers, and consumers? contributors? giving or taking? Should we change how we see the world?\r\n\r\nare users or AI - participants - members - citizens - can or would you want to create digital union? a democracy?\r\nUsers may have an identity, but they will also keep a contextual persona or role.\r\n\r\nNeed to determine how to address a human vs non-human.\r\nRefine the root primitive, but consider the life of the primitive and its experience and relationships.\r\n\r\nLocation of users will need a form of decentralized technologies or federated centralized database .\r\nIntroduced the concept of keysigning your web of friends - connections and community -does not have to be decentralized - \r\nIt can be used as proof of credibility and interaction.\r\nPeople can spin up multiple identities, but it is a credibility reset where they would need to re-earn trust of identity - trust of that you build in your identity -so you can regain your trust currency through your actions \r\n\r\nNeed to clearly find a tangible way to measure - do not want to use a point-based system as actions and perceptions are relative to the beholder.\r\n\r\n## Action Items\r\n\r\nBuild and define charter out\r\nDiscuss and define what to call the root primitive.\r\nDiscuss the proof of credibility model for identities.\r\n\r\n## Items for next week's meeting\r\n**List items that need to be discussed next week**\r\n\r\n## Open Discussion Items\r\n\r\nList any additional items below!\r\n","author":{"login":"OBWANDO"},"comments":{"nodes":[{"id":"DC_kwDOI2aXx84AS1fa","author":{"login":"LaylBongers"},"body":"A few thoughts that may be useful for the meeting:\r\n\r\n- should we in users also include the idea of 'automated' users (automated systems, AI agents/assistants?, 'pet' avatars like an AI dog following a user?)\r\n- if so, how do we prevent abuse with excessive automation, people with a lot of resources running a lot of AI agents? some kind of 'prove you're a human' system?\r\n- voluntary (non-required) consistent identification between sessions as a core feature?"}]},"labels":{"nodes":[]}}]}}}}
